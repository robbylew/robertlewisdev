# Private Projects

Hey there! üëã Thanks for checking out my projects!

## Why can't I see these repositories?

I built these projects during my time at Georgia Tech's Master's program, and due to academic guidelines, I need to keep them private to prevent any code sharing or academic integrity issues. Trust me, I'd love to show them off openly!

## Need access? No problem!

If you're:
- A potential employer curious about my work
- A fellow GT student (with instructor approval)
- Someone I'm collaborating with

Just shoot me a quick message at [contact@robertlewis.dev](mailto:contact@robertlewis.dev) with:
- Who you are
- Why you're interested
- Which project caught your eye

I'll get back to you super quickly (usually same day). For GT folks, I might need to verify with instructors before sharing certain coursework.
