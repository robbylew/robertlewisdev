Hey, I am Robert Lewis, a passionate software engineer.

I am currently seeking exciting opportunities in the tech world.

I hold a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science from UCLA, where I built a strong foundation in data analytics and machine learning. I am now a student at Georgia Tech, pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science as part of their OMSCS program. Additionally, I am working towards earning my CompTIA Network+ and Security+ certifications to demonstrate my dedication and expertise in computer science and cybersecurity.

Driven by a passion for innovative projects and continuous learning, I strive to leverage my skills to deliver impactful data-driven solutions.

Outside of my professional life, I enjoy traveling and spending quality time with my Australian Shepherd, [Hannah](/hannah).
