**Hello, I’m Robert Lewis**—a Dutch-born, American-raised Data Engineer dedicated to constructing and optimizing large-scale data infrastructures. With a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science from UCLA and ongoing M.S. studies in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, I blend analytical expertise with hands-on engineering experience.

I design and implement efficient data pipelines and develop robust ETL workflows using cutting-edge big data tools and cloud platforms. Whether architecting data warehouses, refining real-time data streaming processes, or ensuring data integrity across systems, I excel in turning raw data into actionable insights that drive business growth.

When I’m not engineering data solutions, I love traveling and embarking on adventures with my Australian Shepherd, [Hannah](/hannah).

Thanks for stopping by—feel free to explore my [projects](/projects) or [get in touch](/chat) to discuss how I can help transform your data challenges into strategic opportunities!
