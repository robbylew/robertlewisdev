Hey, I am Robert Lewis, a data engineer and big data enthusiast.

M.S. in Computer Science student at {Georgia Tech}<br>
Data Engineer Intern at {Honeywell}<br>
Bachelor's in Statistics & Data Science from {UCLA}

I build data pipelines that don't fall over and ETL processes that actually deliver. My passion lies in wrangling messy data into something usefulâ€”whether that's setting up real-time streaming systems or making databases talk to each other without throwing tantrums.

You can find my [projects](/projects) and read my [blog posts](/blogs) where I share thoughts on data engineering and tech. If you're curious about my work, check out my [resume](/resume).

When I'm not coding or tackling grad school assignments, I'm exploring hiking trails with my Australian Shepherd, [Hannah](/hannah).
