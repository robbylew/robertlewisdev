## Hey there, I'm Robert! ðŸ‘‹

A big data nerd currently working my way through Georgia Tech's online CS Master's program. My journey started with a bachelors in Statistics & Data Science from UCLA, and I've been hooked on all things data ever since. [View my resume](/resume) for the full story.

By day, I build data pipelines that don't fall over and ETL processes that actually deliver. I'm fascinated by the challenges of wrangling messy data into something usefulâ€”whether that's setting up real-time streaming systems or making sure databases talk to each other without throwing tantrums.

When I'm not knee-deep in code or drowning in grad school assignments, I'm probably exploring a new hiking trail or playing fetch with my Australian Shepherd, [Hannah](/hannah) (she's my world).

Check out some of my [projects](/projects) if you're curious about what I've been up to lately. Fair warning thoughâ€”the cool stuff from my GT coursework is behind academic guidelines, but I'm happy to chat about them!
