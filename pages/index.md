**Hey there, I’m Robert Lewis**—*a Dutch-born, American-raised* software engineer with a strong foundation in data analytics and machine learning. I earned a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science from UCLA and am currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech.

I’m passionate about solving complex problems in data engineering, machine learning, and software development. Beyond my professional pursuits, I love traveling and spending time with my Australian Shepherd, [Hannah](/hannah).

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore my work or get in touch.
