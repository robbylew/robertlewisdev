Hey, I am Robert Lewis, a passionate software engineer.

Beginning my MSCS at Georgia Tech in August 2024.
Currently looking for exciting opportunities in the tech world.<br>

I have a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science from UCLA, where I developed a strong foundation in data analytics and machine learning. I am currently in pursuit of my CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certificates to prove both my devotion and knowledge in the field of computer science and cyber technology.

Driven by a passion for exploring innovative projects and continuously learning, I aim to leverage my skills to drive impactful data-driven solutions.

Outside of my professional life, I enjoy traveling and spending quality time with my Australian Shepherd, [Hannah](/hannah).
